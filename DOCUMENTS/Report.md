Scenario: 
You are developing a software that is used for Space craft launching. The company has many research facilities around the world, meaning facilities within the United States compared to Australia would use the imperial system. The research is done in Australia thus calculations are done in meters. The launch is done be performed in the US as Australia lacks the resources to do so. The software created is to convert meters to feet. Once completed the US scientists use the software and find faults in the conversion, being one decimal off. The software has rounded the numbers too early before the final calculation, which can cause critical rounding errors in the final result. As a consequence the men aboard the spacecraft may be place in a fatal position.

a. Discuss how lack of ethical and professionalism can result in harmful effects using the code you have designed and implemented. You may refer to lecture 9, seven points useful in identifying ethical issues, as a guidance.

Acting with ethics is a result of professionalism, as it is assumed that doing a job "properly" results in working with ethics. However ethics are subjective and depends on the context of what is right and wrong. A lack of ethics is present, the faulty software has affected the safety of the "public", specifically the men who are aboard the spacecraft. Due to this the software developer's integrity may come into question, resulting in a termination of duties. The developer has put the  "public" lives at risks. As with calculations done within space, a minor rounding error can be costly, thus the criticality of rounding increases. The developer of the software has not acted ethically as this mistake has caused harm to the "public" and may affect the reputation of the company in addition to great financial losses, resulting in becoming  unable to perform another launch. The principle of deontology, is a duty or obligation that is upheld by software engineers. The developer of this conversion software had an obligation to the company and the men boarding the spacecraft, but due to this mistake it would portray the developer as negligent. Thus the integrity of the developer is compromised. In reference to consequentialism, the developer is acting unethical, as they did not understand the consequences of their actions to the greatest degree of accuracy due to the context. The programmer for the software is a new developer that has little experience with big companies. Thus once the developer is tasked with the job, they are offered a bonus of $15 000 when completed within a specified time limit. The developer completes it in time. Believing their code is flawless. The developer was too focused on the bonus and did not execute proper error checking. This is a clear conflict of interest as he is prioritising his personal gain over the safety of the "public".

b. Using ACS or IEEE-CS Ethical guidelines, give two suggestions to avoid ethical and professional issues in your software proposed in this assignment. 

To avoid the conflict of interest that can be seen above; personal gain over the safety of the public. In the ACS code of ethics, the first value is primacy of public interest. The developer should be placing the interests above those of personal gain/interests. To combat this the developer may undergo various types of self-reflection and morality reflection. The integrity of the developer and the code have come under question, a lack of professionalism and incompetence, as they have ruined the reputation of the company. Employees could look at and memorise moral exemplars that are made specific to their company, to act in ethically in the eyes of their employer. For example the ACS guidelines hope to improve professionalism, enhancing the integrity of the company. As each person may have their own morals and may justify all their actions as ethical, it becomes essential that things such as the ACS guidelines exist. These are a set of guidelines for the employees to follow. If an employee followed the guidelines it can result professional development, meaning greater professionalism thus working in a way that is ethical.
